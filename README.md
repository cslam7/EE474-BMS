# EE474-wi21

This is the home page of Cory and Abderrahmane's EE 474 Winter 2021 Lab Group!

The purpose of this course is to develop our understanding of embedded system and software development via a battery management system.

This will be done iteratively, so expect each lab to get more and more complex until we have something cool to put on our resume! :)
